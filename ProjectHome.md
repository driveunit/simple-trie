# Introduction #
This is an implementation of a generic prefix trie. The code is written in pure C++ template. The trie is very similar to STL associative container in its usage.

Currently following features are supported.
  * Iterator support
  * Addition of an element
  * Removal of an element
  * Retrieval of an element
  * Checking the existence of an element
  * Finding element with a given key
  * Finding elements with common prefix
